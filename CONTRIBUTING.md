## Pull Request Workflow

Before starting any new work, please check the [existing issues](https://github.com/naMqe-h/trench-map/issues) to see if someone else is already working on a similar feature or bug. This helps avoid duplicate efforts.

1.  **Fork the repository**
    Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the main repository page. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

2.  **Create a feature branch**
    Clone your forked repository to your local machine and create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive branch name.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/naMqe-h/trench-map.git
    cd trench-map
    git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
    ```

3.  **Local Setup**
    Set up your local environment by creating an environment file, installing dependencies, and starting the development server.
    
    *   Copy the environment variables file (use the command for your OS):
        *   Linux / macOS: `cp .env.example .env.local`
        *   Windows CMD: `copy .env.example .env.local`
        *   Windows PowerShell: `Copy-Item .env.example -Destination .env.local`
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    *   Run the development server to verify everything works:
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```

4.  **Commit your changes**
    Make your changes and commit them. This project follows the [**Conventional Commits**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. Commit messages should be prefixed with a type, such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, or `docs:`.
    ```sh
    git commit -m "feat: Add amazing new feature"
    ```

5.  **Push to the branch**
    Push your changes up to your forked repository on GitHub.
    ```sh
    git push origin feature/amazing-feature
    ```

6.  **Open a Pull Request**
    Go to the original TrenchMap repository and you will see a prompt to create a Pull Request from your new branch. Click it, and open a new PR against the `main` branch.

When you submit your pull request, please provide a clear description of the problem you are solving and the changes you have made. Include any relevant context, screenshots, or GIFs to help us understand your contribution.

Thank you for helping make TrenchMap better!
